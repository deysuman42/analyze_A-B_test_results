# analyze_A-B_test_results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

For this project, I analyzed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

An e-commerce website implemented a new web page for their website. 

The goal of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website and infer whether to   implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Performed sampling distribution as well as Logistics Regression to compare the derived ‘p’ value with the threshold interval and finalized whether to accept the Null hypothesis or reject it.
