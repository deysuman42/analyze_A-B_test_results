# analyze_A-B_test_results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

For this project, I analyzed to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

An e-commerce website implemented a new web page for their website. 

The goal was to perform  Hypothesis testing and A/B testing to help the company understand whether to keep the old page or go  with the new one.

Performed sampling distribution as well as Logistics Regression to compare the derived ‘p’ value with the threshold interval and finalized whether to accept the Null hypothesis or reject it.
